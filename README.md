# Busy Beaver Game

Experiments with complexity theory, turing machines and the halting problem for fun

### Problem

How many ones can a halting turing machine print on a blank (all 0) tape?

- We are concerned with two symbol machines âˆˆ{0, 1}
- Machines start in "A" state
- Only halting machines are scored
- Number of possible TMs with n states: (4n+1))^(2n)
